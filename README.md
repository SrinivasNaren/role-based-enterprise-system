# Role-Based Enterprise Task & Workflow Management System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an enterprise-style role-based system designed to demonstrate
how real-world applications handle authentication, authorization, workflows,
and security.

## 🎯 Key Goals
- Single login for all users
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure JWT authentication
- Admin & Author workflows
- Permission-driven UI and APIs

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Most projects focus only on CRUD.
This project focuses on **system design, security, and scalability** —
the way real companies build internal tools.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture
- Frontend: React (Protected Routes, Role-based UI)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Auth: JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens)
- Authorization: RBAC Middleware
- Database: Users, Roles, Permissions, Posts
